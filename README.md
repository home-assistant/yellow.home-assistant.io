# Home Assistant Yellow website

This is the source of the Yellow documentation website at [yellow.home-assistant.io](https://yellow.home-assistant.io). 

## Setup

This website is built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). The website is automatically deployed using Netlify.

## Development

The easiest way to edit the documentation is to open the environment in Github Codespaces. Codespaces work in your browser, no installation required.
1. Further up on this page, select the green **Code** button. 
2. On the **Codespaces** tab, select **Open in codesapce**.
3. Make your changes and push them.
4. You are amazing! Thank you for contributing.


If you prefer to run this locally, the recommended development environment is Visual Studio Code. The repository uses [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). When opening a checked out version of this repository, make sure to open it in the Dev Container (Ctrl+Shift+P > **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...**)

If you prefer other editors, Dev Containers is an open standard and can be used with other editors. See [containers.dev](ttps://containers.dev/) for more information on supported editors.

### Preview

There is a pre-configured task to run a preview version of the website. Use Ctrl+Shift+P, and select **Tasks: Run tasks**.
