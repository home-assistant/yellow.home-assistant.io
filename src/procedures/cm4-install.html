      - title: Protecting from ESD

        content: |
          <p>Grounding protects the components from the static electricity that can be naturally present (electrostatic discharge, ESD).</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="warning">Always: Touch the working surface before touching electronics. </li>
            <li>Ideally: Use ESD protective equipment, such as ESD table mats and grounding cords.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Removing the case - bottom part

          <ul>
            <li>Remove the 4 screws on the bottom of the Home Assistant Yellow Kit.</li>
            <li>Keep the thumb screws close by; you will need them again later.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Make sure the interfaces are facing towards your left.</li>
            <li>Flip the case over.</li>
            <li>Slightly lift off the enclosure on your left.</li>
            <li>Slide the enclosure off towards your right.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Unpacking the components

        content: |
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure you have all the components:</li>
            <li>1 Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4).</li>
            <li>1 heat sink</li>
            <li>2 thermal pads</li>
            <li>2 push pins</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Installing the CM4
        image: step-6-poe-install-cm4.jpeg
        content: |
          <ul>
            <li>The raspberry icon needs to be upside down: check for correct orientation of the CM4.</li>
            <li>Press the CM4 board onto the board-to-board connectors until it clicks into place.</li>
            <li>Make sure you press on both sides (the two long edges).</li>
            <li>Make sure the CM4 is installed correctly: it needs to run parallel to the yellow board.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Placing the thermal pads onto the CM4
        image: step-7-poe-heat-pads-placement_callouts.jpeg
        content: |
          <ul>
            <li>Remove the protective cover from one side of the square thermal pad.</li>
            <li>Stick the unprotected side onto the SOC (the silver square next to the raspberry icon).</li>
            <li>Remove the protective cover from the top side of the thermal pad.</li>
            <li>Repeat the steps with the rectangular thermal pad. Place it on the memory (the black rectangle next to the SOC).</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Installing the heat sink
        image: step-8-install-heatsink.webp
        content: |
          <ul>
            <li>Push the 2 plastic push pins into the dedicated hole on the heat sink.</li>
            <li>Start by first aligning the right plastic push pins into the dedicated hole on the carrier board.</li>
            <li>Then, place the heat sink onto the CM4.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Fixating the heat sink

        content: |
          <ul>
            <li>Take the entire board off your workplace and push the pins firmly through the carrier board.</li>
          </ul>
