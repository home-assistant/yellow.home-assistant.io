          <ul>
            <li>Home Assistant Yellow</li>
            <li>2 heat pads: heat pad memory, heat pad SOC</li>
            <li>Heat sink</li>
            <li>Ethernet cable</li>
            <li>Raspberry Pi CM4 Module (not part of Kit)</li>
            <li>NVMe M.2 SSD drive (optional, not part of kit)</li>
            <li>Optional: No. 1 hex screwdriver (required for NVMe drive)</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Touch something that has a direct conductive path to the earth, such as a water pipe, a wooden table, or the exterior metal box of your desktop computer.</li>
            <li>This protects the components from the static electricity that is naturally present in your body - grounding is an extra safeguard.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Remove the 4 screws on the bottom of the Home Assistant Yellow Kit

          <ul>
            <li>Keep the thumb screws close by; you will need them again later.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Remove the translucent enclosure

          <ul>
            <li>Make sure the interfaces are facing towards your left.</li>
            <li>Flip the case over.</li>
            <li>Slightly lift off the enclosure on your left.</li>
            <li>Slide the enclosure off towards your right.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Unpack the Raspberry Pi CM4 Module.

          <ul>
            <li>The berry icon needs to be upside down: check for correct orientation of the CM4. </li>
            <li>Press the CM4 board onto the board-to-board connectors until it clicks into place.</li>
            <li>Make sure you press on both sides (the two long edges).</li>
            <li>Verify it is parallel to the yellow board.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Place the heat pads onto the memory and the SOC on the CM4 Module.

          <ul>
            <li>Remove the protective cover from one side of the heat pad.</li>
            <li>Stick the unprotected side onto the memory / SOC.</li>
            <li>Remove the protective cover from the top side of the heat pad.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Install the heat sink.

          <ul>
            <li>Push the two plastic push pins into the dedicated hole on the heat sink.</li>
            <li>Start by first aligning the right plastic push pins into the dedicated hole on the carrier board.</li>
            <li>Then, place the heatsink onto the CM4.</li>
            <li>Lastly, take the PCB off your workplace and push the pins firmly through the carrier board.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Fixate the heat sink.
