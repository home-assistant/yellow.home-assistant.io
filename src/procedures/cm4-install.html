          <ul>
            <li>Make sure you have all the components:</li>
            <li>1 Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4).</li>
            <li>1 heat sink</li>
            <li>2 thermal pads</li>
            <li>2 push pins</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Installing the CM4

          <ul>
            <li>The raspberry icon needs to be upside down: check for correct orientation of the CM4.</li>
            <li>Press the CM4 board onto the board-to-board connectors until it clicks into place.</li>
            <li>Make sure you press on both sides (the two long edges).</li>
            <li>Make sure the CM4 is installed correctly: it needs to run parallel to the yellow board.</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Placing the thermal pads onto the CM4

          <ul>
            <li>Remove the protective cover from one side of the square thermal pad.</li>
            <li>Stick the unprotected side onto the SOC (the silver square next to the raspberry icon).</li>
            <li>Remove the protective cover from the top side of the thermal pad.</li>
            <li>Repeat the steps with the rectangular thermal pad. Place it on the memory (the black rectangle next to the SOC).</li>
          </ul>
      - title: Placing the heat sink

          <ul>
            <li>Push the 2 plastic push pins into the dedicated hole on the heat sink.</li>
            <li>Start by first aligning the right plastic push pins into the dedicated hole on the carrier board.</li>
            <li>Then, place the heat sink onto the CM4.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Take the entire board off your workplace and push the pins firmly through the carrier board.</li>
          </ul>
