    <p>This guide assumes you have the following setup:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Home Assistant Yellow up and running.</li>
      <li>Home Assistant OS installation.</li>
      <li>Multiprotocol support disabled: Refer to the <a href="/guides/disable-multiprotocol/">Disable multiprotocol support</a> procedure.</li>
      <li class="info">This guide installs a firmware which supports only Thread! If you use your Yellow
        to control Zigbee devices, you will no longer be able to control them after installing the Thread
        firmware. If you'd like to keep using Zigbee, add a SkyConnect or a different radio, or try the
        Multiprotocol support (experimental).
      </li>
      <li class="warning">Home Assistant Supervised: The Thread border router has some specific requirements
        on IPv6 configuration (for example, IPv6 routing needs to be enabled). The add-on is being tested on the Home Assistant OS.
        If you experience connectivity issues, try using a Home Assistant OS installation.
      </li>
    </ul>
