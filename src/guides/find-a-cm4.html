  <p>
    The Home Assistant Yellow comes with a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4
    pre-installed with Home Assistant. The Home Assistant Yellow Kit does not.
    This means that you need to bring your own to be able to assemble your kit.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is currenlty a chip shortage that is severely impacting the
    availability of Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. Our recommendation is to use
    <a href="https://rpilocator.com/" target="_blank">rpilocator</a>. This
    website tracks official Raspberry Pi distributors if they have any products
    in stock. If you follow them on Twitter, you can enable push notifications
    when the bot tweets, so you will be instantly notified you when new stock is
    available.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend to get a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 with at least 2GB of
    RAM. The amount of space can be as low as 16GB, or none if you decide to use
    an NVMe SSD hard drive.
