      this procedure, make sure to use the built-in device wipe mechanism.</span

      >By default, the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 has a fixed boot order: it
      tries to boot from the internal eMMC before booting from a USB mass
      storage device. In rare cases, the internal eMMC is deemed
      bootable, but does not boot into a working system. In this case, there are
      two options you can try to reinstall Home Assistant OS.</span

    <span><h2>Option 1 (recommended): Reinstall Home Assistant OS using Red + Blue button</h2></span>
  </p>
  <p><span>This option works with Home Assistant OS 8.5 and later only.</span></p>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>
      <span>Remove power from your system.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Power up the system.</span>

    <li>
      <span
        >Within 5s (or from start), press and hold the red and blue button on
        the backside of the device simultaneously.</span
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Hold the two buttons until only the red LED is lit.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Remove power from your system.</span>

        >Run the Raspberry Pi Imager and flash the <b>Home Assistant OS Installer for Yellow</b> onto
        the eMMC ("RPi-MSD"). Refer to

          Step 1 through 5</a> from the <b>Installing Home Assistant Software on Kit</b> procedure for the exact steps.
        Windows might bring up a message asking to insert a disk, this message can be closed. Ignore the
        Raspberry Pi Imager prompt to remove the SD card. Select <b>Continue</b> and
        close the Raspberry Pi Installer.
