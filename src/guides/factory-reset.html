        >A factory reset clears the data partition of your device. It removes all user data as well as Home Assistant Core, Supervisor, and any installed add-ons.</p> 
        <p>The Home Assistant operating system stays on the system.</p>
        <p>Once a factory reset is initiated, the data partition is marked as to be cleared on boot. Then, the system reinstalls the latest version of all Home Assistant components.</p>
