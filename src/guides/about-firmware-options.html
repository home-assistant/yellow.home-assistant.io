    <p>This section has two goals: 
        <ol>
            <li>List the currently available firmware options for Home Assistant Yellow and Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 (the two devices have the same radio chip built-in).</li>
            <li>List the different add-ons and integrations related to these options and show their relationships.</li>
        </ol></p>
    <h1>Currently available firmware</h1>
     <p>
        <span>
            There are currently 2 different firmware options for Home Assistant Yellow:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Zigbee firmware</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the firmware that runs a Zigbee network. It is preinstalled on Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 and Yellow.</li>
                        <li>Bundled in the <b>Silicon Labs Flasher</b> add-on. In case you have installed one of the other two options at some point, this add-on allows you to re-install the Zigbee firmware. Note that the add-on is only used to flash the firmware. It is never used during operation: <abbr title="Zigbee Home Automation">ZHA</abbr> communicates with the Zigbee firmware directly.</li>
                        <li>Other terms you may have seen to designate this firmware: EmberZNet firmware, <abbr title="EmberZnet serial protocol">EZSP</abbr> firmware, Zigbee EZSP.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Thread firmware</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This firmware allows to use Yellow or Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 as a dedicated Thread border router when used with the <b>Open Thread Border Router addon</b>.</li>
                        <li>Bundled in the <b>Open Thread Border Router</b> add-on.</li>
                        <li>Other terms you may have seen to designate this firmware: OpenThread RCP, RCP OT</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
