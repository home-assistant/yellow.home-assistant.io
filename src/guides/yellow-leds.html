      >Home Assistant Yellow has 3 LEDs. The red and green LED's behavior is similar to
      the red and green LED on a Raspberry Pi. The yellow LED is specific to Home Assistant Yellow.
      It indicates Home Assistant specific information.</span
    >
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Red LED (D4): Power LED</li>
    <li>Green LED (D5): Activity LED</li>
    <li>Yellow LED (D6): Home Assistant Yellow system health LED</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Power LED (red)</h2>
  <span
    >The power LED indicates whether the CM4 is powered. If the LED is off, check
    the power supply. If the LED continues to be off,
    remove power, and check if the CM4 is properly seated on the Yellow PCB.</span
  >

  <h2>Activity LED (green)</h2>
  <span
    >The activity LED indicates various firmware and boot loader states at
    startup. If CM4 fails to boot, the pattern indicates what the reason is.
    Refer to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#led-warning-flash-codes">
    LED Warning Flash Codes</a> table of the Raspberry Pi documentation</span
  >
  <span
    >Once Home Assistant OS has been started, the green LED indicates activity.
    Activity is defined as disk (eMMC/NVMe) or any CPU load.</span
