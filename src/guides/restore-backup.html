        <span><h1>Restoring or migrating from a backup</h1></span>
      <span
        ><p>There are two ways you can use a backup:
          <ul>
            <li>You can use a backup to recover your existing configuration on your current system.</li>
            <li>You can use a backup during the onboarding process to restore your configuration. For example, if you want to migrate from another device to a Home Assistant Yellow.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>        
        <p>A full backup includes the following elements:
          <ul>
            <li>your system configuration</li>
            <li>add-on data</li>
            <li>automations</li>
            <li>scripts</li>
            <li>and media stored on Home Assistant.</li>
          </ul></p></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span><h2>Estimated duration</h2></span>
    </p>
    <p>The time it takes to restore a backup depends on your installation. Home Assistant Core and all add-ons are being reinstalled. <ul>
      <li>For a larger installation, this process can take about 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    </ul></p>
