  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><b>Note</b>: Multiprotocol is an <b>experimental</b> feature. It may not work for you. If it does not work, you may need to disable multi-protocol and you might even need to re-pair your devices.</p>

      Home Assistant Yellow's integrated wireless chip supports Zigbee by default.
      By updating the firmware, the wireless chip can be used in a multiprotocol
      setup supporting Zigbee and Thread at the same time! There are two
      limitations: The two networks have to be on the same channel and share the
      bandwidth. This page explains the background.</span

  </p>
  <h2>About channels</h2>
  <p><span>Both Zigbee and Thread are low-rate wireless personal area networks
    (LR-WPAN, IEEE 802.15.4). The standard specifies 16 channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz
    spectrum (channel number 11-25). The standard supports multiple networks on
    the same channel. Each network is identified by a PAN-ID (personal area network
    identifier).
  </span></p>
  <p><span>
    The wireless chip in Home Assistant Yellow supports all 16 channels. However,
    it can only communicate on one single channel at a time. Due to this limitation
    it is crucial that Zigbee and Thread run on the same channel for reliable
    operation!
    
    Thanks to the PAN-ID, the Zigbee and Thread networks are still separated and
    therefore won't interfere with each other.
  </span></p>
  <h2>About bandwidth</h2>
  <p><span>
    IEEE 802.15.4 (so both Zigbee and Thread) support a transfer rate of up to
    250&nbsp;kbit/s. For typical Zigbee and Thread networks this is sufficient.
    However, in the multiprotocol setup Zigbee and Thread networks need to share
    the same channel, and therefor share the 250&nbsp;kbit/s transfer rate. Furthermore,
    if Wi-Fi or other 2.4&nbsp;GHz networks are running in a similar frequency range,
    transfer rate might be further limited.
  </span></p>
  <p><span>
    For large networks it is advisable to add a second wireless chip. This allows
    to run Zigbee and Thread each on a dedicated wireless chip and on separate
    channels.

  <h2 id="resolve-channel-conflict">Resolve channel conflict</h2>
  <p>You may get a notification stating that the OTBR and ZHA share the same  radio, but use different channels. This mode of operation may cause an unreliable network connection. To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following methods: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Option 1</b>: Reset the Thread network by using the <b>Reset border router</b> button. <img src="/images/multiprotocol-reset-thread-network.png"/><ul>
      <li>After resetting the Thread network, re-pair your devices.</li></ul></li>
      <li><b>Option 2</b>: Use two separate chips, one for each network.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>On your Home Assistant Yellow, <a href="/guides/disable-multiprotocol/" target="_blank">disable multiprotocol support</a> and restore the Zigbee network.</li>
        <li>Plug in a SkyConnect and setup a new Thread network there.</li>
      </ol></li>
