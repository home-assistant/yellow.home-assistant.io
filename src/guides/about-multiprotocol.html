  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><b>Note</b>: Multiprotocol is an <b>experimental</b> feature. It may not work for you. If it does not work, you may need to disable multi-protocol and you might even need to re-pair your devices.</p>

      Home Assistant Yellow's integrated wireless chip supports Zigbee by default.
      By updating the firmware, the wireless chip can be used in a multiprotocol
      setup supporting Zigbee and Thread at the same time! There are two
      limitations: The two networks have to be on the same channel and share the
      bandwidth. This page explains the background.</span

  </p>
  <h2>About channels</h2>
  <p><span>Both Zigbee and Thread are low-rate wireless personal area networks
    (LR-WPAN, IEEE 802.15.4). The standard specifies 16 channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz
    spectrum (channel number 11-25). The standard supports multiple networks on
    the same channel. Each network is identified by a PAN-ID (personal area network
    identifier).
  </span></p>
  <p><span>
    The wireless chip in Home Assistant Yellow supports all 16 channels. However,
    it can only communicate on one single channel at a time. Due to this limitation, it is crucial that Zigbee and Thread run on the same channel for reliable operation!
    
    Thanks to the PAN-ID, the Zigbee and Thread networks are still separated and
    therefore won't interfere with each other. <br>
    <p>
    The illustration below shows on which frequency range each channel operates. It also shows on which channels a specific protocol operates. 
    <ul>
      <li>Grey sections mark the channels used by Wi-Fi.</li>
      <li>Blue sections mark the channels used by Bluetooth Low Energy.</li>
      <li>Orange sections mark the channels used both by Zigbee and Thread.</li>
    </ul>
    Zigbee/Thread channels 15, 20, and 25 are less likely to be affected by Wi-Fi interference since they are in between the most commonly Wi-Fi channels 1, 6 and 11.

  <h2>About bandwidth</h2>
  <p><span>
    IEEE 802.15.4 (so both Zigbee and Thread) support a transfer rate of up to
    250&nbsp;kbit/s. For typical Zigbee and Thread networks this is sufficient.
    However, in the multiprotocol setup Zigbee and Thread networks need to share
    the same channel, and therefore share the 250&nbsp;kbit/s transfer rate. Furthermore,
    if Wi-Fi or other 2.4&nbsp;GHz networks are running in a similar frequency range,
    transfer rate might be further limited.
  </span></p>
  <p><span>
    For large networks it is advisable to add a second wireless chip. This allows
    to run Zigbee and Thread each on a dedicated wireless chip and on separate
    channels.

  <h2 id="resolve-channel-conflict">Resolve channel conflict</h2>
  <p>You may get a notification stating that the OTBR and ZHA share the same  radio, but use different channels. This mode of operation may cause an unreliable network connection. To resolve this issue, you can try one of the following methods: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Option 1</b>: Make sure Zigbee and Thread are on the same channel.
        <ol>
          <li>On the Thread integration, select <b>Configure</b>, then select the info button.</li>
          <li>Take note of the number listed under <b>Channel</b>  <img src="/images/thread-show-channel.png"/></li>
          <li>On the Zigbee integration, select <b>Configure</b>.</li>
          <li>If the <b>Channel</b> number is not same as for Thread, change the channel. <img src="/images/zigbee-edit-channel.png"/></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>Option 2</b>: Reset the Thread network. This will make sure Thread uses the same channel as ZHA.
        <ol>
          <li>To reset the Thread network, select the <b>Reset border router</b> button. <img src="/images/multiprotocol-reset-thread-network.png"/></li>
          <li>Re-pair your Thread devices.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>Option 3</b>: Use two separate wireless chips, one for each network. For example by adding a Home Assistant SkyConnect as a second wireless chip.
        <ol>
            <li>On your Home Assistant Yellow, <a href="/guides/disable-multiprotocol/" target="_blank">disable
                    multiprotocol support</a> and restore the Zigbee network.</li>
            <li>Plug in a SkyConnect.</li>
            <li>Go to <a class="my"
                    href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=core_openthread_border_router"
                    target="_blank"><b>Add-ons</b></a> and install the experimental <b>OpenThread Border Router</b>
                add-on.
                <li>Select the <b>Configuration</b> tab and pick the serial port with SkyConnect.</li>
                <li>Select <b>Save</b>.</li>
                <li>Start the add-on. Your Home Assistant SkyConnect is now set up to work exclusively with Thread.
                     You can now start adding your Thread devices.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    </ul>
