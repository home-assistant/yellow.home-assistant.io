      I can’t access the system via http://homeassistant.local:8123, what can
      I do?
    content: >
      Try <a href="http://homeassistant:8123" target="_blank">http://homeassistant:8123</a>.
      If that does not help, you may be able to find the IP address of Home
      Assistant Yellow on your router.

      My Home Assistant Yellow appears broken (no LEDs, or only red LED).
      What can I do?
    content: >
      <p>
        The green Compute Module 4 might gotten unseated during transportation.
        Open the Yellow enclosure and make sure the green PCB is seated correctly.
        Press onto the heat-sink on the two marked spots (centered above the
        CPU/SoC) to snap the CM4 in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure that the jumper JP2 is not connected. This means the jumper is only touching one of the pins, not both.
      </p>

  - title: Can I factory reset the system?
    content: >
      Yes: Remove power from your system, reapply power, press and hold the red
      button within 5 seconds. Keep the red button pressed until the yellow led
      starts to flash. The Yellow now clears the data partition, which
      includes Home Assistant Core, the Supervisor, and any installed add-ons.
      Make sure that Internet connection is present at this point - the
      Home Assistant Operating System needs to download the Home Assistant
      Supervisor and Core after the data partition has been cleared. Due to
      the downloads, it can take a while until Home Assistant becomes accessible
      again.
  - title: >
      Can I reinstall Home Assistant OS again using the USB flash drive with
      the Home Assistant OS Installer for Yellow?
    content: >
      By default, the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) tries to boot from
      internal eMMC before trying to boot from the USB flash drive. Therefore, the
      Home Assistant OS Installer for Yellow will only get started if the CM4
      is empty.

      Home Assistant OS 8.5 or newer versions: To clean the boot files from the internal eMMC,
      press and hold both the red and the blue button at startup.
      Keep the two buttons pressed for at least 15 seconds. Now, the system
      should boot from the USB flash drive again.
  - title: >
      What is the serial port of the Zigbee radio?
    content: >
      The Zigbee/Thread (IEEE 802.15.4) radio is directly connected via serial
      port to the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 on <code>/dev/ttyAMA1</code>.
      Note that there is <i>no</i> <code>/dev/serial/by-id</code> path for this
      serial port as its not connected through USB. The above tty path will
      remain static.
