  <h2>The expandable smart home hub for Home Assistant</h2>
  <span
    >Home Assistant Yellow is the first smart home hub that was produced specifically for Home Assistant. It can be expanded with additional computing power or storage to grow with your smart home. 
    With Home Assistant Yellow, you can control your lights, thermostat,
    TV, music, and more. Home Assistant integrates with over 1,000
    different devices and services. Home Assistant works with popular
    brands like Philips Hue and also that odd-ball lightbulb you picked up
    at a sale.</span>
