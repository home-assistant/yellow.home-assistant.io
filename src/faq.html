          How do I find a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4?
        content: >
          <p>You could use <a href="https://rpilocator.com/" target="_blank">rpilocator</a>. This website tracks the stock of official Raspberry Pi distributors. Follow them on Twitter and enable push notifications. You will be notified as soon as the bot tweets that products are in stock.
          </p>
          <p>
          We recommend purchasing a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 with the following characteristics: 
          <ul>
            <li>Min. 2&nbsp;GB of RAM.</li>
            <li>Min. 16&nbsp;GB of eMMC flash space.</li>
            <li>If you opt for the CM4 Lite: as it does not have an eMMC module, you must use an NVMe SSD hard drive. Some users reported that the <a href="/faq/#which-ssds-are-not-supported">following SSDs</a> are not working on the Home Assistant Yellow.</li>
          </ul>

          Which SSDs are supported?
        content: >
          <p>
            Yellow has an <b>M.2 M-Key</b> connector which supports <b>NVMe SSDs</b> with M-Keying 
            and length of <b>2230</b>, <b>2242</b>, <b>2260</b>, or <b>2280</b>. 
            <ul>
              <li>The Raspberry Pi
                CM4 has a single lane PCIe 2.0 (Gen 2.0 x1). PCIe is backwards
                compatible.</li>
              <li>NVMe SSDs supporting a newer generation of PCIe or more,
                supporting multiple lanes, should generally work (e.g. Samsung 970 EVO
                Plus MZ-V7S500BW with a PCIe Gen 3.0 x4 interface is known to work).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>A high-end NVMe is not required, since the CM4 PCIe interface is only Gen 2.0 x1.</br>
              A low-cost NVMe is typically good enough.</p>

          Which SSDs are NOT supported?
        content: >
          <p>
            All M.2 SATA SSDs are <b style="color: rgb(216, 93, 118);">NOT</b> supported. Besides the
            following NVMe SSDs are known to <b style="color: rgb(216, 93, 118);">NOT</b> work:
            <ul style="color: rgb(216, 93, 118);">
              <li>WD_BLACK SN850X (1TB)</li>
              <li>WD_BLACK SN770</li>
              <li>WD_BLACK SN750 SE</li>
              <li>SK Hynix BC711</li>
              <li>Crucial P2 CT250P2SSD8</li>
              <li>Lexar NM620</li>
              <li>Samsung 980 Pro</li>
              <li>Samsung PM9B1 MZAL4256HBJD-00BL2 Rev 0</li>
            </ul>
            Usually, if one model doesn't work, other models from the same product
            family have a high chance to be affected as well. Other models may work,
            e.g. the WD Blue SN570 reportedly works, Crucial P2 CT500P2SSD8 (512GB)
            and Crucial P5 CT1000P5SSD8 (1TB) as well.

          Is Zigbee2MQTT supported by the on-board radio?
        content: >
          <p>
            The Home Assistant Yellow team officially supports ZHA (Zigbee Home
            Automation), the Zigbee stack integrated into Home Assistant Core.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Zigbee2MQTT project has <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/adapters/#experimental" >
            experimental support</a> (in beta stage) for the Silicon Labs radio on
            Home Assistant Yellow. With this setting Zigbee2MQTT is known to work
            on Home Assistant Yellow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note: The Zigbee Home Automation integration is active by default! If
            you are using Zigbee2MQTT, remember to delete and ignore the discovered
            Zigbee Home Automation integration to avoid interference.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Note: When setting up Zigbee2MQTT with the Home Assistant Yellow, you will
            need to configure the adapter type in Zigbee2MQTT. Make sure the following
            is present in your Zigbee2MQTT configuration:
            <pre><code>serial:
              adapter: ezsp
              port: /dev/ttyAMA1
              baudrate: 115200
              rtscts: true</code></pre>
          </p>
      - title: >
          What is the serial port of the Zigbee radio?
        content: >
          The Zigbee/Thread (IEEE 802.15.4) radio is directly connected via serial
          port to the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 on <code>/dev/ttyAMA1</code>.
          Note that there is <i>no</i> <code>/dev/serial/by-id</code> path for this
          serial port as its not connected through USB. The above tty path will
          remain static.

            When do I need to replace the CR2032 coin-cell battery?
        content: >
          <p>
            The Duracell CR2032 shipped with Home Assistant Yellow is estimated to last 10 years or more (with self-discharge taken into account). Replacement likely won't be necessary within the product's lifetime. If your RTC does not show the correct date, this is likely because the initial time synchronization failed. Make sure that your Internet router does not block NTP (Network Time Protocol) traffic.
          </p>
          <p>In case you do replace the battery, make sure the positive side is facing upwards. You should see the plus sign.</p>

            What is the purpose of the 3.5 mm barrel audio jack?
        content: >
          <p>
            The 3.5 mm barrel audio jack can be connected to an amplifier and used in combination with the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/vlc_telnet#home-assistant-add-on" target="_blank">VLC</a> add-on. This exposes the output as a media player in Home Assistant Core.
          </p>
      - title: >
          Can I buy the Home Assistant Yellow pre-assembled?
        content: >
          <p>No. We previously offered a Home Assistant Yellow Standard model that came pre-assembled with a Raspberry Pi CM4, but this model is no longer manufactured. It is now recommended that if you want a more plug-and-play experience, you purchase a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/green" target="_blank">Home Assistant Green</a>, as it requires no assembly and matches many of the capabilities of the Yellow, especially if you add a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/connectzbt1/" target="_blank">Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1</a> to give it Zigbee/Thread capability.
          </p>
      - title: >
          What happened to Home Assistant Yellow Standard, and will it still be supported?
        content: >
          <p>The Home Assistant Yellow Standard was originally designed to be the beginner option in our product line, as it was pre-assembled and easier to get started with. In 2023, we launched the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/green" target="_blank">Home Assistant Green</a>, which offered similar features, including easy setup, but at a lower price point. This led us to end the manufacture of the Home Assistant Yellow Standard and focus on Yellow Kit versions for advanced users. Rest assured, as the Home Assistant Yellow Standard hardware is identical to our Kits, it will continue to receive the same support and software updates.

            Multiprotocol: I get a notification stating that the OTBR and ZHA share the same radio, but use different channels. What can I do?
        content: >
          <p>
            Note: The multiprotocol feature is still experimental.
          </p>
          <p>OTBR and ZHA on separate channels can cause an unreliable network connection. To resolve this issue, you can try resetting the Thread network or use two separate wireless chips, one for ZHA and one for Thread. See <a href="/guides/about-multiprotocol/#resolve-channel-conflict" target="_blank">About
            multiprotocol support - resolve channel conflict</a>.</p>
          <p>Note: The OpenThread Border Router add-on used to setup a Thread-only network on a wireless chip is still experimental.</p>

          My Home Assistant Yellow appears broken, no LED is lighting up. What can I do?
        content: >
          <p>
            The green Compute Module 4 (CM4) might not be seated correctly.
            Open the Yellow enclosure and check if the green CM4 PCB is parallel to
            the Yellow PCB.
          </p>

          <p><img src="/images/faq-unseated-side-view.jpeg" /></p>

          <p>
            If this is not the case, check if the CM4 is well aligned with the
            white outline on the Yellow PCB. If the CM4 is not aligned, align it
            first before pressing onto the heat-sink. For that you will have to
            remove the heat-sink first. If the green PCB is aligned, press onto
            the heat-sink on the two marked spots (centered above the CPU/SoC) to
            snap the CM4 in place.

          My Home Assistant Yellow lights up the red LED only. What can I do?
        content: >
          <p><b>Note</b>: The resolution described below only applies to revision 1.2 and older. Starting with revision 1.3, there is no JP2 jumper that could cause this issue.</p>
          <p>
            Most likely your Compute Module 4 is in USB boot mode. Make sure that
            the jumper JP2 is not connected. This means the jumper is only touching
            one of the pins, not both.

      - title: Can I factory reset the system?
        content: >
          <p>
            Yes. To clear all user data as well as Home Assistant Core, Home Assistant Supervisor, and any installed add-ons from the system, perform a <a href="/guides/factory-reset/" target="_blank">factory reset</a> procedure.

          Can I reinstall Home Assistant OS again using the USB flash drive with
          the Home Assistant OS Installer for Yellow?
        content: >
          <p>
            By default, the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) tries to boot from
            internal eMMC before trying to boot from the USB flash drive. Therefore, the
            Home Assistant OS Installer for Yellow will only get started if the CM4
            is empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Home Assistant OS 8.5 or newer versions: To clean the boot files from the internal eMMC,
            press and hold both the red and the blue button at startup.
            Keep the two buttons pressed for at least 15 seconds. Now, the system
            should boot from the USB flash drive again.
